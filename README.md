# CP-Resiliency-Energy-Assessment-Toolkit
Created as a senior project from some EE students at Cal Poly SLO. This toolkit is an attempt to build a solar PV and battery sizing estimating toolkit to be used for early project evaluations.

This tool is similar to ARUP's SolarResilient tool but made to be more open for other students to work off of and expand in the future. This toolkit is a very rough estimator and should not be used for true project design, it is intended for very early project evaluation and design to see some range in values and numbers the user may expect for their project.

The project references several other softwares and sources for equations. These references and credit to them are included in our final report which can be found in Cal Poly's senior project library.
